This public repository tracks *IT and operations* (i.e., not science) for the Neuroimaging Core @ Atlanta VA CVNR / Emory University Department of Neurology. Until project portfolio management is implemented elsewhere, this repo centralizes our non-sensitive ops content:
  - issue tracking
  - system documentation for workstations, servers, and VMs
  - budgeting and forecasting


Are you having software/login/network trouble?
================================
Core users: please submit trouble tickets by clicking the green "New Issue" button in the upper-right corner of the [issues page](http://j.mp/braindown) . This will require you to first sign up for a free GitHub account, which is not a bad thing.


Looking for actual science?
===============================
Infrastructure aside, projects receiving scientific support from Neuroimaging Core salaries can be followed by watching any of the proj.* repos in https://github.com/CVNRneuroimaging
