#Brief translations of jargon for timekeeper:
(a rolling work in progress)

##alignment
a.k.a. spatial coregistration. Aligning multiple brain images so that their onanatomy overlaps in space.

##anatomic processing
a.k.a. T1 anatomic processing or T1 processing. Preparing a high-resolution T1 anatomic image for further analysis. Generally includes skull-stripping, as well as detection and treatment of artifacts.

##behavioral data
a.k.a. Bx data. Analysis of behavioral data collected in or out of the scanner. Maybe including demographic data.

##FMRI denoising
Removing undesired noise from collected FMRI images prior to further processing. Currently experimenting with multiple methods.

##FMRI network analysis
FMRI analysis techniques that allow us to ask questions about how activity is correlated across multiple regions of the brain. Currently experimenting with multiple methods.

##FMRI physio
Removal of FMRI noise specifically related to respiration and cardiac activity.

##FMRI quality control (QC)
Qualitative and quantitative analysis of our acquired FMRI data.

##FMRI single-session (aka 1st-level) processing
Analysis of how well the FMRI task timing predicts the collected FMRI voxel intensities. Includes the pre-processing steps necessary to prepare the data for this analysis, i.e., everything after quality control, denoising, physio, but before network or group analysis.

##FreeSurfer
Analysis of high-resolution T1 anatomic images that divides the whole brain into many small anatomic parcels, allowing us to calculate the volume of specific regions of interest as well as manipulate maps of those individual regions.

##white matter hyperintensities (WMHI)
Measurement of WMHIs provides a volume and spatial map of these lesions that are associated with both disease and "healthy" aging. Currently experimenting with multiple methods.
